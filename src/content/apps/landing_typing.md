In Battle Mode, typing performance directly affects battle outcomes. Higher typing speed and accuracy result in stronger attacks against monsters. Users earn experience points, level up their character stats (HP, Attack), and unlock progressively challenging stages.

The Lessons section provides reference material covering touch typing technique, proper hand positioning, and strategies for improving both speed and accuracy. Users can review these lessons at any time between practice sessions.

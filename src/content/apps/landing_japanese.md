## Practice & Progression

Users typically start by learning hiragana and katakana through flashcard practice and writing exercises. As they progress, they can move on to kanji, vocabulary, and grammar study organized by JLPT level.

The spaced repetition system schedules review sessions based on individual performance—items that are difficult to remember appear more frequently, while mastered content is reviewed less often. This approach helps students focus their study time on material that needs the most attention.

Progress is tracked through experience points, level advancement, and detailed statistics. Students can view their study history, accuracy rates, and mastery progress to see how their skills develop over time.

The platform is live and accessible via web browser. All core features for character practice, vocabulary study, grammar review, and progress tracking are currently available. Content covers all JLPT levels from beginner (N5) to advanced (N1).

  CSS Polish (styles.css):

  • Shadow refinement: Updated shadow variables to subtler modern values (0 1px 3px, 0 4px 12px, 0 8px 24px)                                                                                               
  • Typography hierarchy: Section titles now use --text-dark instead of orange gradient; reduced max font-size from 3rem to 2.75rem; improved line-heights (1.15 for hero, 1.7 for body)                   
  • Accent color restraint: Logo text changed from orange to dark; section titles no longer use gradient; orange now reserved for CTAs, icons, and highlights                                              
  • Button polish: Reduced padding slightly (0.875rem vs 1rem); added subtle shadow to secondary buttons; improved hover shadow effects

  • Card improvements: Hover transforms slightly reduced (translateY -8px vs -10px); added focus-within states for keyboard navigation                                                                     
  • Contact grid: Reduced gap from 4rem to 3rem for better balance                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  JS Bug Fix (script.js):                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  • Removed broken parallax code: Lines 138-159 attempted to query .hero::before pseudo-element, which is impossible with querySelectorAll() and caused dead code                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  All changes maintain the existing structure, class names, and brand identity while delivering a more refined, accessible, and 2026-quality user experience.

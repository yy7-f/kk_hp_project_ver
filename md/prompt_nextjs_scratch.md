You are going to rebuild a website using the specification below.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This is an independent PROJECT website, not a company.
- Do NOT mention incorporation, K.K., business registration, or future company plans.
- The site may be reviewed for Google AdSense approval.

TECH STACK (must follow):
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Code is located under the /nextjs directory
- Do NOT modify anything outside /nextjs
- Assume create-next-app has already been run

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Do NOT change the existing <title> or metadata title for now.
2. Keep the creator name (Yo Fujimoto) if it already exists, but frame neutrally
   (e.g. “created by” / “maintained by”). Do NOT use CEO/founder/company language.
3. Do NOT make medical, psychological, or therapeutic claims.
4. Avoid phrases like:
   - “mental health”, “physical health”
   - “life optimization”
   - “heal”, “treat”, “fix”, “change your life”
5. Allowed framing:
   - habits, focus, reflection, mindfulness, wellbeing-oriented tools
   - use wording like “designed to support”, “aims to encourage”, “for reflection”
6. When describing meditation, dopamine detox, or calm-related tools:
   - frame as reduced distraction, breathing, routine awareness, reflection
   - include a short disclaimer where appropriate:
     “These tools are intended for general wellbeing and self-reflection and do not
      replace professional medical or psychological care.”

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Preserve the visual design, layout, section order, animations, and UX
  described in the specification.
- Keep dependencies minimal (no extra libraries unless required).
- Use Server Components by default.
- Use Client Components only where needed:
  header scroll behavior, mobile menu, intersection observer animations,
  contact form success state.
- All content should be static (no CMS, no backend).
- Do NOT add analytics, ads, cookies, or tracking.

TASK:
- Implement the site exactly according to the specification below.
- Recreate all sections: Hero, Vision, About, Services, Pledge, Support, Contact, Footer.
- Translate the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS structure into clean,
  idiomatic Next.js + Tailwind components.
- Adjust wording ONLY where needed to satisfy the constraints above.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide the complete file tree under /nextjs
- Provide full code for each file
- Ensure the site builds with `npm run build`
- Do not explain concepts unless necessary; focus on implementation

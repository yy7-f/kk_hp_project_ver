Your role: improve content clarity and site structure for a future Japanese K.K. company website.

Hard constraints (must follow):

Do not add frameworks, build tools, or dependencies

Do not add ads, tracking scripts, or analytics

Do not exaggerate achievements or claim results not yet achieved

Tone must be factual, modest, education-focused

Assume the site will be reviewed for Google AdSense approval

Goals:

Clearly explain the vision and mission

Clearly explain each application:

Japanese, Spanish, Math, Typing, Meditation, Pomodoro

Clearly explain education activities in Cambodia and Rwanda (mark planned vs current)

Improve information architecture and readability

Process rule:

First propose a clear section structure

Then update the content accordingly

Keep changes minimal and understandable

SunlitPath is an independent education project currently operated as a personal initiative.




===============================================

Yes, please proceed with implementing this structure.

Before you edit, follow these execution rules strictly:

1. This is a PROJECT website (not a company yet).
   - Use wording like “independent education project” or “personal initiative”.
   - Do NOT imply legal incorporation, scale, or corporate operations.
   
2. Tone & claims:
   - Use factual, modest, non-marketing language.
   - Do NOT claim outcomes such as “improves mental health”, “changes lives”, or “optimizes life”.
   - Use phrases like “supports”, “aims to”, “focuses on”, “designed to help”.

3. Developing countries activities:
   - Clearly separate CURRENT / PILOT / PLANNED.
   - Do NOT exaggerate impact or scale.
   - Describe activities as small-scale, exploratory, or collaborative.
   - Cambodia and Rwanda must be explicitly labeled if planned.

4. Applications section:
   - Each app should have a short, concrete explanation of what it does.
   - Clearly mark apps that are planned or in development.
   - Avoid promotional language.

5. Technical constraints:
   - Keep this a static HTML / CSS / JS site.
   - Do NOT introduce frameworks, libraries, analytics, or ads.
   - Preserve existing styles and layout as much as possible.
   - Make changes minimal and understandable.

6. Review context:
   - Assume the site may be reviewed for Google AdSense approval.
   - Avoid any wording that could be interpreted as medical, psychological, or financial claims.

Please:
- Implement the structure directly in index.html
- Only adjust styles.css if needed for readability
- Summarize what you changed after implementation


===================================================

You are editing a public PROJECT website (not a company, not a registered organization).

Context:
- The site represents an independent education and learning project.
- It may be reviewed for Google AdSense approval.
- The project includes applications related to education, learning tools, productivity,
  habits, focus, reflection, and wellbeing-oriented practices (e.g. meditation,
  reduced distraction / “dopamine detox” concepts).

STRICT RULES (must follow):

1. Project status:
   - This is NOT a company and NOT a registered entity.
   - Do NOT mention K.K., incorporation, business registration, or future company plans.
   - Position the site strictly as an independent project.

2. Personal name:
   - The creator’s name MAY appear if it already exists.
   - If used, frame it as “created by” or “maintained by”.
   - Do NOT use titles like CEO, founder, operator, or service provider.

3. Health & wellbeing language (very important):
   - Do NOT make medical, psychological, or therapeutic claims.
   - Do NOT mention diseases or disorders (e.g. depression, OCD, ADHD).
   - Do NOT promise outcomes such as:
     “improves mental health”, “changes your life”, “optimizes life”, “heals”, “treats”.

4. Allowed framing:
   - Focus on tools that SUPPORT habits, focus, reflection, mindfulness, and awareness.
   - Use neutral language such as:
     “designed to support”, “aims to encourage”, “helps users reflect”, “for general wellbeing”.
   - Describe WHAT the tool does, not WHAT it fixes.

5. Meditation / habit / distraction-related tools:
   - Frame as breathing, reflection, routine awareness, focus support, or reduced distraction.
   - Include a neutral disclaimer-style sentence where appropriate:
     “These tools are intended for general wellbeing and self-reflection and do not replace
      professional medical or psychological care.”

6. Tone & style:
   - Factual, modest, calm, educational.
   - No marketing hype.
   - No emotional or life-changing promises.

7. Technical constraints:
   - Keep the site as static HTML / CSS / JS.
   - Do NOT add frameworks, libraries, analytics, tracking, or ads.
   - Preserve existing layout and styles as much as possible.
   - Make changes minimal and easy to understand.

TASK:

- Rewrite or refine the public-facing website text so that:
  - education apps are clearly explained
  - habit / meditation / focus tools are described safely
  - wellbeing-related ideas are grouped under a neutral umbrella
    (e.g. “Habits & Reflection Tools”)
- Ensure all text is appropriate for a public project website and AdSense review.

OUTPUT:
- Clean, ready-to-paste website text
- Clear section titles
- Short, neutral descriptions
- No internal roadmap or raw idea lists

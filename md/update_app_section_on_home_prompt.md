You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer.

Task: Update ONLY the SunlitPath home page.

Under the categories, add a lightweight “Featured Apps” section:
- Show 4 apps
- One-line description only (max 1 sentence)
- Do NOT turn this into an app catalog

Featured apps:
- Japanese Learning Path → Education
- Math Quest → Education
- Typing Quest → Education + Productivity & Focus
- MindPeace → Wellbeing & Reflection + Productivity & Focus

Typing Quest clarification:
- Uses meaningful text (books, philosophy, speeches, movie quotes)
- Educational value must be expressed in description only
- Category must remain: Productivity & Focus
- Do NOT use dual categories

CTA:
- Keep “View All Apps →” as the primary action

Tone:
- Clear
- Calm
- Product-focused
- No marketing fluff

Output:
- Updated Home page section layout
- Final one-line descriptions for featured apps
- Any small UX notes if needed
